# General-NN
General neural network code with flexible layers and activations.

* The dims sizes and activation for each layer should be passed to the class as lists.
* The batch size should be mentioned
* The input matrix should be of shape (n_x,m) where n_x is the number of inputs and m is the number of training examples. (For Vectorisation)
* The ouput matrix will be of shape (n_y,m) where n_y is the number of outputs and m is the number of training examples.
* numpy required
* Modify the cost function and the derivative of it accordingly.
* Accuracy will be printed w.r.t the validation set given. Pls modify the accuracy function accordingly
